<p><strong>Research Projects</strong></p>
<ul>
Research on Automatic Speech Recognition	06/2022-now
•	Research on Automatic Speech Recognition by using kaldi and learn network quantization	
Research on Speech Enhancement	12/2021-06/2022
•	Researched status on speech enhancement based on the combination of deep learning and conventional statistical methods.	
Research on Multiple Source Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks	01/2020-12/2021
•	The received signal strength (RSS) observations was employed for the multiple source 
localization (MSL). Then, the MSL problem was reformulated as a joint sparse signal 
recovery and parametric dictionary learning problem. Finally, a MSL approach was explored 
based on sparse Bayesian learning and variational inference.
•	The related work has been finished and summarized in a regular paper
Research on Single Source Localization based on Deep Neural Network	09/2019-12/2019
•	Single source localization was investigated with a convolutional neural network (CNN), based on the information of time delay of arrival (TDOA) and the associated amplitude.	
•	The related work has been completed as a submitted patent.	
Research on Speaker Tracking based on Distributed Auxiliary Particle Filter	05/2018-11/2018
•	A distributed auxiliary particle filter-based speaker tracking technology was explored. 	
•	The related work has been completed as a patent.
